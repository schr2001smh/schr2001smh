# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @schr2001smh

I'm a Computer Science student at Ben-Gurion University. Before that, I began my academic journey at the Open University while serving in the military. I'm passionate about software development and love building thingsâ€”especially video games in my spare time.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests
- Game development
- Systems programming
- Creative coding projects
- Building cool and useful tools

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I'm always learning something new! Lately, I've been diving into:

## ðŸ§© Fun Fact
When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy creating game prototypes and experimenting with physics-based mechanics.

Feel free to check out my projects or connect with me!
